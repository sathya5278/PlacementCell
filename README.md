# college-mern
A MERN stack app for college placement stuff.

### Steps to make it work in your system:
* git clone this repo
* run `npm install` inside this repo, and also inside `client` folder.
* create a mongodb database
* create a user with read-write permissions on that database only.
* get MongoDB URI. If you don't know the format, google it.
* put MongoDB URI in `server.js` file
* use the command `npm run dev` for running project. No need to run client and server separately, because I've installed 'concurrently' package and set it up.
* after changes, do the usual pull request style. No need to fork this project, for now. Just directly use my repo url to push directly. 
> BUT DON'T MERGE THE CHANGES UNTIL I SEE THE PULL REQUESTS.
